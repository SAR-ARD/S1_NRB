Usage
=====

Configuration
-------------
Usage of the S1_NRB package relies on a configuration file that needs to be set up by the user. The configuration
file follows the INI format, which uses plain text to store properties as key-value pairs. INI files can be created and
opened with any text editor. An example ``config.ini`` file for the S1_NRB package can be found here:

https://github.com/SAR-ARD/S1_NRB/blob/main/config.ini

Configuration files in INI format can have different sections. Each section begins at a section name and ends at the next
section name. The ``config.ini`` file used with the S1_NRB package should at least have a dedicated section for processing
related parameters. This section is by default named ``[PROCESSING]``.
Users might create several processing sections in the same configuration file with parameter values that correspond to different
processing scenarios (e.g., for different areas of interest). Note that each section must contain all necessary
configuration parameters even if only a few are varied between the sections.

The following provides an overview of the parameters the ``config.ini`` should contain and anything that should be
considered when selecting their values:

Processing Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **mode**

Options: ``all | nrb | rtc``

This parameter determines if the entire processing chain should be executed or only part of it.

- **aoi_tiles** & **aoi_geometry**

The area of interest (AOI) for which S1-NRB products should be created.

``aoi_tiles`` can be used to define the area of interest via MGRS tile IDs, which must be provided comma-separated (e.g.,
``aoi_tiles = 32TNS, 32TMT, 32TMS``). ``aoi_geometry`` defines the area of interest via a full path to a vector file
supported by :class:`spatialist.vector.Vector`. This option will automatically search for overlapping MGRS tiles and use
these for processing.
Both parameters are optional and can be set to ``None`` or left empty. ``aoi_tiles`` overrides ``aoi_geometry``.
If neither is defined, all tiles overlapping with the scene search result are processed.

- **mindate** & **maxdate**

The time period to create S1-NRB products for.
Allowed are all string representations that can be parsed by :meth:`dateutil.parser.parse`.

- **date_strict**
Treat dates as strict limits or also allow flexible limits to incorporate scenes
whose acquisition period overlaps with the defined limit?

 + strict: start >= mindate & stop <= maxdate
 + not strict: stop >= mindate & start <= maxdate

- **sensor**

Options: ``S1A | S1B``

The Sentinel-1 sensor/platform.

- **acq_mode**

Options: ``IW | EW | SM``

The acquisition mode of the source scenes that should be processed.

- **product**

Options: ``GRD | SLC``

The product of the source scenes that should be processed.

- **datatake**

The datatake ID in hexadecimal representation, e.g. 04EBF7.

- **work_dir**

``work_dir`` is the main directory in which any subdirectories and files are stored that are generated during processing.
Needs to be provided as full path to an existing directory.

- **rtc_dir**, **tmp_dir**, **nrb_dir**, **wbm_dir** & **log_dir**

Processing S1-NRB products creates many intermediate files that are expected to be stored in separate subdirectories. The
default values provided in the example configuration file linked above are recommended and will automatically create
subdirectories relative to the directory specified with ``work_dir``. E.g., ``nrb_dir = NRB`` will create the subdirectory
``/<work_dir>/NRB``. Optionally, full paths to existing directories can be provided for all of these parameters.

- search option I: **scene_dir** & **db_file**

Metadata of any Sentinel-1 scene found in ``scene_dir`` will be stored in an SQLite database file created by :class:`pyrosar.drivers.Archive`.
With ``db_file`` either a full path to an existing database can be provided or it will be created in ``work_dir`` if only
a filename is provided. E.g., ``db_file = scenes.db`` will automatically create the database file ``/<work_dir>/scenes.db``.
``scene_dir`` needs to be provided as full path to an existing directory and will be searched recursively for any Sentinel-1 scenes using the regex pattern ``'^S1[AB].*(SAFE|zip)$'``.

- search option II: **stac_catalog** & **stac_collections**

Alternative to searching scenes in a directory and storing their metadata in an SQLite database, scenes can be queried from a STAC catalog.
For this, a STAC URL and one or many collections can be defined with ``stac_catalog`` and ``stac_collections`` respectively.
The scenes are expected to be locally accessible in unpacked folders with the `.SAFE` extension.

- **kml_file**

The Sentinel-2 Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiling system establishes the basis of the processing chain and a
local reference file containing the respective tile information for processing S1-NRB products is needed. The official
KML file defined for the Sentinel-2 mission provided by ESA can be retrieved `here <https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/1955685/S2A_OPER_GIP_TILPAR_MPC__20151209T095117_V20150622T000000_21000101T000000_B00.kml>`_.
With the ``kml_file`` parameter either a full path to this reference file can be provided or it is expected to be located
in the directory provided with ``work_dir`` if only a filename is provided. E.g., the processor expects to find
``/<work_dir>/s2_grid.kml`` if ``kml_file = s2_grid.kml``.

- **dem_type**

Options: ``Copernicus 10m EEA DEM | Copernicus 30m Global DEM II | Copernicus 30m Global DEM | GETASSE30``

The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) that should be used for processing.

Note that water body masks are not available for "GETASSE30", and will therefore not be
included in the product data mask. "Copernicus 10m EEA DEM" and "Copernicus 30m Global DEM II" (both include water body masks)
are retrieved from the `Copernicus Space Component Data Access system (CSCDA) <https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/web/cscda/data-access/registration>`_,
which requires registration. The processor reads username and password from the environment variables `DEM_USER`
and `DEM_PASS` if possible and otherwise interactively asks for authentication if one of these DEM options is selected.

- **gdal_threads**

Temporarily changes GDAL_NUM_THREADS during processing. Will be reset after processing has finished.

- **measurement**

Options: ``gamma | sigma``

The backscatter measurement convention. Either creates gamma naught RTC (:math:`\gamma^0_T`) or ellipsoidal sigma naught (:math:`\sigma^0_E`).

- **annotation**

A comma-separated list to define the annotation layers to be created. Supported options:

 + dm: data mask (four masks: not layover not shadow, layover, shadow, ocean water)
 + ei: ellipsoidal incident angle (needed for computing geolocation accuracy)
 + em: digital elevation model
 + id: acquisition ID image (source scene ID per pixel)
 + lc: RTC local contributing area
 + li: local incident angle
 + np: noise power (NESZ, per polarization)
 + gs: gamma-sigma ratio: sigma0 RTC / gamma0 RTC (ignored if ``measurement`` is not gamma)
 + sg: sigma-gamma ratio: gamma0 RTC / sigma0 ellipsoidal (ignored if ``measurement`` is not sigma)

Use one of the following to create no annotation layer:

 + ``annotation =``
 + ``annotation = None``

- **etad** & **etad_dir**

Determines if the `Extended Timing Annotation Dataset (ETAD) correction <https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/data-products/etad-dataset>`_
should be performed or not. If ``etad=True``, ``etad_dir`` is searched for ETAD products matching the respective input SLC
and a new SLC is created in ``tmp_dir``, which is then used for all other processing steps. If ``etad=False``, ``etad_dir``
will be ignored.

Metadata Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **format**

A comma-separated list to define the metadata file formats to be created. Supported options:

 + OGC: XML file according to `OGC EO <https://docs.ogc.org/is/10-157r4/10-157r4.html>`_ standard
 + STAC: JSON file according to the `SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/>`_ family of specifications

- **copy_original**

Copy the original metadata of the source scene(s)? This will copy the manifest.safe file and annotation folder into the
S1-NRB product subdirectory: ``/source/<ProductIdentifier>``.

- **access_url**, **licence**, **doi** & **processing_center**

The metadata files created for each S1-NRB product contain some fields that should not be hidden away and hardcoded with
arbitrary values. Instead, they can be accessed here in order to more easily generate a complete set of metadata. These
fields are mostly relevant if you want to produce S1-NRB products systematically and make them available for others.
If you don't see a need for them you can just leave the fields empty, use the default 'None' or delete this entire section.

Command Line Interface
----------------------
Once a configuration file has been created and all of its parameters have been properly defined, it can be used to start
the processor using the command line interface (CLI) tool provided with the S1_NRB package.

The following options are currently available.

Print a help message for the CLI tool:

::

    s1_nrb --help

Print the processor version:

::

    s1_nrb --version

Start the processor using parameters defined in the default section of a ``config.ini`` file:

::

    s1_nrb -c /path/to/config.ini

Start the processor using parameters defined in section ``SECTION_NAME`` of a ``config.ini`` file:

::

    s1_nrb -c /path/to/config.ini -s SECTION_NAME

Start the processor using parameters defined in the default section of a ``config.ini`` file but
override some parameters, e.g. ``acq_mode`` and ``annotation``:

::

    s1_nrb -c /path/to/config.ini --acq_mode IW --annotation dm,id
