    "Let's assume you have a collection of S1-NRB scenes located on your local disk, a fileserver or somewhere in the cloud.

    "The **only step necessary to get started** with analysing your collection of scenes, is the creation of STAC Collection and Catalog files, which connect individual STAC Items and thereby create a hierarchy of STAC objects. `s1ard` includes the utility function [make_catalog](https://s1-nrb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#s1ard.metadata.stac.make_catalog), which will create these files for you. Please note that `make_catalog` expects a directory structure based on MGRS tile IDs, which allows for efficient data querying and access. After user confirmation it will take care of reorganizing your S1-NRB scenes if this directory structure doesn't exist yet."
