# [db_file] The database to index scenes found in [scene_dir] will be generated by pyroSAR if it doesn't exist already.
# [kml_file] The Sentinel-2 Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiling system can be retrieved as a KML file from:
# https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/1955685/S2A_OPER_GIP_TILPAR_MPC__20151209T095117_V20150622T000000_21000101T000000_B00.kml
